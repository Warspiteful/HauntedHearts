While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 64, in script
    "Out of everyone that piques your interest, there’s [have pictures fade in and out as the descriptions come and go] a creepy looking guy in a robe and glasses, a beefy vampire in shorts and a sleeveless shirt, a really impressive Mothman costume with... a detective's outfit on top? And... a classic bedsheet ghost."
KeyError: u'have pictures fade in and out as the descriptions come and go'
